## Summary

* JavaScript was a client-side language, so has no built-in primitives for interacting with the file system.
* The ability to manipulate the file system is central to server-side programming.
* NodeJS provides the `fs` and `path` modules to achieve this.

## Learning Objectives

* Understand path manipulation in Node.
* Query files and directories for meta-data and permissions controls.
* Dynamically respond to file system changes.
* Discover various ways to write files and read files and directories.
